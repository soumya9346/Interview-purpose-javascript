control statements -- control statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program based on a
                      certain condition
1. Decision making or conditional statements
2. looping or iteration statements
3. jump statements


decision making or conditional statements: conditional statements are used for a certain block of code need
                                           to be executed when some condition is fullfilled.
                            1. If
                            2. If-else
                            3. If-else-If
                            4. switch

looping or iteration statement: used to execute a statement or set of statement multiple times.
                                it execute the statement untill the condition is true within the loop.

                            1. while
                                     it checks the condition first then execute the statement later.
                                     it is a entry controlled loop
                            2. do while
                                     it executes the statement first then checks the condition later
                                     it is a exit controlled loop
                            3. for 
                                     if the number of iteration are known then we can use For loop.
                                     it is a entry controlled loop

jump statement: it is used to transfer the control from one point to another point
                            1. Break 
                                     the break statement is used to terminate the loop or statement in which 
                                     it is present
                            2. continue
                                     the continue statement is used to skip the execution part of the loop on a 
                                     condition
